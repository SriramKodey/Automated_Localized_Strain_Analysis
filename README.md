# Automated_Localized_Strain_Analysis
  1) Single point surface strain analysis using automated measurement of distortion in Square Gridpattern.  (A novel method was developed)
  2) Quadrilaterals identified from images of grid patterns captured using a microscope.  
  3) Equations of sides of quadrilateral calculated using Hough Transform and K-Means Clustering.  
  4) Corners of quadrilateral calculated from these equations.
  5) Projective Transformation was applied using the calculated corners to inscribe ellipses inside convexquadrilaterals, for single point surface strain analysis.
